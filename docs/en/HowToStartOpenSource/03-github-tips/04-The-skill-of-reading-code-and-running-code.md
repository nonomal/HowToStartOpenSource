## Read the code

Press `directly on the warehouse details page` key, the project will open in the web version of vscode, and we can browse as if we were local.
Not only can you switch files to read at any time, enjoy code highlighting tips, quick jumps, code searches, and even install plugins to enhance the editor's functionality.

## Run the code

Prefix the project address with `gitpod.io/#/`

1. Not only does the project code open in the web editor, but the category of the project (frontend/Java, etc.) is automatically recognized. 
2. Project dependencies are automatically installed.
3. You can use the remote server provided by this web page as your own computer.
4. Execute the project, view the running effect, and build the Docker image with one click.
